# oscar-bot
personal music I made to replace groovy for my friends and I to listen to in discord. The name is based off Oscar the butler from aristocats disney movie that would fetch milk for the cats whenever they're hungry. This robot fetches us music whenever we need music to remove the awkwardness during our conversations.

### tl;dr
  * a robot the plays music from the top result from youtube in discord that utilises the youtube-dl and discord.py and since it's private and doesn't earn any money it bypass the rules and guidelines that youtube used to take down Groovy and similar robots. It also has other features added for long-distance game night purposes (Obviously it's long distance otherwise we wouldn't use discord, we'd just whip out a speaker and use spotify on our phones to play music)

### Current Features
 * Music Player
   - Plays music from youtube using the ffmpeg library to extract the audio from videos
 * Wikipedia api (photos and summaries)
   - Bcan bring us random tl;dr of certain topics if we're too lazy to look up and use Google while playing since opening another application costs ram
 * NEWS API
   - It's also connected to the newsapi so we can keep up to date with the real world since we're holed up during when I made this in covid

### Future Additional Features
 * CO-OP games suggestion
   - We're really lazy looking up games to play is already using too much brain power for us.
 * Movie suggestions
   - This one is also a hassle for us, we can't decide on what movie to watch.
 * Event organiser and reminder
   - Finds the most optimal time and event for all of us to meet up in real life, we're not adulting very well
